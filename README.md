# GJMRaspberryPiLEDBlink
Blink a LED light using Raspberry Pi's GPIO

#### CRAFTING THE CIRCUIT
To craft the circuit you will need 
- 2 Jumper Cables
- 1 BreadBoard (Maybe you can use duct tape)
- 1 220 ohms resistor
- 1 LED

Electricity Path:

Pin 18 (GPIO 24) → Jumper → BreadBoard → Resistor → LED → Breadboard → Jumper → Pin 6 (Ground)

If you don't have a breadboard, just ducktape everything.

#### HOW TO RUN IT
Just run the `ledblinkRaspberry.py` file with superuser privileges (admin).
(You obviouly need to have Python installed).
